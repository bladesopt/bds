function D = get_direction_set(n, options)
%GET_DIRECTION_SET generates the set of polling directions and returns a vector of indices of valid 
%   directions.
%
%   If the user does not input OPTIONS or the OPTIONS does not contain the field of direction_set, 
%   D will be [e_1, -e_1, ..., e_n, -e_n], where e_i is the i-th coordinate vector. Otherwise, 
%   options.direction_set should be a n-by-n nonsingular matrix, and D will be set to 
%   [d_1, -d_1, ..., d_n, -d_n], where d_i is the i-th column in options.direction_set. 
%   If the columns of options.direction_set are almost linearly dependent, then we will revise 
%   direction_set in the following way.
%   1. Remove the directions whose norms are too small.
%   2. Find directions that are almost parallel. Then preserve the first one and remove the others.
%   3. Find a maximal linearly independent subset of the directions, and supplement this subset with
%      new directions to make a basis of the full space. The final direction set will be this basis. 
%      This is done by QR factorization.
%   For directions from options.direction_set that remain in the final direction_set, their column 
%   positions in the final direction_set are preserved to match their original positions in 
%   options.direction_set.

    % part of parallel_directions, the column indices being contained in parallel_direction_indices

        % independent subset of the direction_set. Then, we supplement this subset with some 
        % directions in Q to make a basis of the full space. For details about how to implement QR 
        % factorization with permutation, see the following explanation. Actually, QR factorization 
        % with permutation is implemented using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. First, we select the
        % longest vector in the direction_set as the first vector in the new direction set. Then, we
        % normalize this vector to be the first column of the Q matrix, denoted as q_1. The second 
        % column of Q, denoted as q_2, is the unit vector along the longest vector in the remaining 
        % vectors {d_2, ..., d_m} after removing the projection of q_1 from them. Repeat this process
        % to get the Q matrix and the R matrix. According to the above process, we have the following
        % properties in the R matrix:
        % 1. The diagonal elements of R are monotonically decreasing.
